I"’<p>Through the quintuple-paned suburban lenses,</p>

<p>a universe of blind quiescence,</p>

<p>a bastardâ€™s adventure, an infinitely finite generation</p>

<p>a binary life constructed, misconstrued</p>

<p>beeps, whirrs, flashes, a stack of bedside books bounded by the black Sag A*</p>

<p>incoherent fiefdoms of antiquity transmogrified a la modernitÃ©</p>

<p>an infinitely finite personal library</p>

<p>an infinitely finite life to scrape the ancient words from their scum-ridden pages, alas,</p>

<p>no bijection exists</p>

<p>a book which contains all books contains itself</p>

<p>a life which contains all lives surely must contain itself?</p>
