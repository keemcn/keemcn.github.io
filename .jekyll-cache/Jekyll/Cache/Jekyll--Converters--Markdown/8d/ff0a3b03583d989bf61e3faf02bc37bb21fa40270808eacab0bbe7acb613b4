I"v<p>I’m currently a Technical Product Manager at a seed-stage stealth startup, and I graduated from <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/">CU Boulder</a> in 2019 with a BA in mathematics. In college, I was a <strong>Research Scientist Intern</strong> at <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">Amazon</a>, where in the summer of ‘18 I worked on the Data Center Systems team and analyzed the power draw of different components inside of Amazon’s global network of Data Centers. I interned there in the summer of ‘17, too, where I did a large-scale analysis of hard drive failures.</p>

<p>In college I was also a <strong>Venture Partner</strong> for <a href="https://contrarycap.com/">Contrary Capital</a>, a student-led VC fund where I sourced deals and found the best startups at my alma mater.</p>

<p>I also interned in a variety of roles at some great startups when I was in high school. These include <strong>Graphic Design</strong> @ <a href="https://humandesign.com/">Human Design</a> and <strong>QA Engineering</strong> and <strong>Front-end Development</strong> @ <a href="https://www.wayin.com/">Wayin</a> (acq. Cheetah Digital).</p>
