I"T<p><strong>We have no clue what AI will be able to do in the future.</strong> It is young. And while we humans do, indeed, have fancy people working on making fancy new tech that does fancy stuff, no one has produced anything that even remotely resembles human-level general cognitive capabilities (the word <em>general</em> is important there, because we sure as hell get our asses kicked by computers at Go, chess, and a multitude of other “narrow” tasks and activities). Nothing created thus far has been able to perform as well as an average human would at any “general” task.</p>
