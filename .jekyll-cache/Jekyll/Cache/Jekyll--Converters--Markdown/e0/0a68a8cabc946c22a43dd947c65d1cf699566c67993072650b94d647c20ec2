I"„<p>American media has a long history of portraying politicians, and people of power more generally, as stupid and naive. Saturday Night Liveâ€™s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JUWSLlz0Fdo&amp;list=PLIMQGnRxY3JH4jtVG5zjmW0Eqqt_jzWSF">political skits</a> are wonderful examples of this. SNL has a distinctly liberal lean, and so tends to focus on GOP figures, but there are many examples of analogous media portrayals from the conservative side of the Overton window, too. Articles and TV segments abound from all across the political spectrum that propound the blatant idiocy and plebeian nature of the other sideâ€™s figureheads.</p>
