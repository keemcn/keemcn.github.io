In a daily ritualistic sacrifice of thumotic potential to techno-Moloch, each torso eventually arrives in its respective portion of the beast. It sits down in its Herman Miller Aeron, adds a few spindly threads to a four-dimensional web of badly-mangled code, and eventually returns to its transparent living-box, a la Zamyatin.</p>
