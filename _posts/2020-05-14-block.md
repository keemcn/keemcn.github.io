monkey clambers

vie for mine ______________ coin

sweat for an electronic modicum

weep for a lost proton

press thread into pulp ______________ into paper

the vine unravel, the Schwein squeal, the blood drip, red ... crimsone ... film, glob, thick, halt.

valleys and mountains in the cushions, causally closed microscopae, logic consummate, a lite blue fizz flows to seas of abstraction. density propounded by men who do not know, grins mimicked by things that will not go. rest not, son incarnate, ride not, heathen cloaked in flesh.
