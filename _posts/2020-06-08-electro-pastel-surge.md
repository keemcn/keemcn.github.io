Through the quintuple-paned suburban lenses,

a universe of blind quiescence,

a bastard's adventure, an infinitely finite generation

a binary life constructed, misconstrued

beeps, whirrs, flashes, a stack of bedside books bounded by the black Sag A*

incoherent fiefdoms of antiquity transmogrified a la modernit√©

an infinitely finite personal library

an infinitely finite life to scrape the ancient words from their scum-ridden pages, alas,

no bijection exists

a book which contains all books contains itself

a life which contains all lives surely must contain itself?
