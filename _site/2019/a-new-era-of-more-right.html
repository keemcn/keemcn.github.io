  <h3 id="an-explanation">an explanation</h3>

<p>Today is the day that I begin surfacing words from my personal reflection-journal/digital-thought-notebook thing. I have a (sort of) daily cadence of writing in it, because doing so helps me keep my head on straight. If I don’t work through the ambient thoughts in my brain in a systematic way like this, the thoughts either implode into nothingness or explode into existential and epistemic anxiety. Both of those outcomes are bad.</p>

<p>Plus, I tweeted <a href="https://twitter.com/keegan_mcnamara/status/1188337574299013120">this</a> the other day, so I figured that instead of perpetuating the problems I pointed out, I’d start trying to solve them.</p>

<p>A large part of me hates disturbing the former serenity and distilled nature of this website with something as filthy and unkempt as mere <em>thoughts</em> and <em>reflections</em> (the bile bubbles to the back of my throat as I type), but I’ve decided that if there’s any net positive effect on humanity as a result of my making such things public, then I ought to do it. As anyone who has taken an Analysis course knows, net positivity is not difficult to do ( <script type="math/tex">\forall \epsilon > 0,\exists...</script>), so I think I indeed ought to start.</p>

<h3 id="some-changes">some changes</h3>
<p>I’d still like there to be features that allow for some semblance of filterability on my writings, so I’ve added a <a href="https://keeganm.org/categories">categories</a> page and a <a href="https://keeganm.org/tags">tags</a> page. Implementing categories and tags from scratch in Jekyll was a bit of a pain in the ass, but I think it’ll be worth it in the longer term. I also have a fair number of thoughts about math and physics-related things, so I added MathJax support (do you even <script type="math/tex">\LaTeX</script>, bro?) for when I desperately need to reminisce on the days I spent breathing in toxic amounts of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhNUjg9X4g8">Hagoromo</a> dust. Again, Jekyll is kind of a pain in the ass to do stuff like this with, but as my good friend Brennie would say, the ‘worth is high’.</p>

<p>I’ll be categorizing these more spontaneous thoughts and writings as ‘posts’, as opposed to the far more time-consuming to produce ‘essays’ and ‘videos’. Perhaps someday I’ll gather the courage to put my poetry and prose on here. We’ll see.</p>

<p>I’ve also changed the look and feel of the site. More specifically…</p>
<ul>
  <li>I changed the paragraph font to what I consider the most beautiful of all serifs, Libre Baskerville. I previously used Helvetica, which is nice for headings, but miserable to read for long periods of time. Such is the life of a sans.</li>
  <li>I removed all of the colors from the site, with the notable exception of salmon (<span style="color: #ff5858;">#ff5858</span>). I use the same salmon color on my <a href="https://twitter.com/keegan_mcnamara">twitter profile</a>, and I enjoy having a cohesive brand identity in this one, very limited way. I’m also a proponent of design minimalism, which leads me to…</li>
  <li>I thinned out all of the lines used for bounding boxes. This allows the elements on the screen to breathe, and it also focuses attention on the ones that matter. The bounding boxes themselves are actually totally unnecessary, but I like how they demarcate territory and group related elements together. They’re also somewhat of an homage to Engelbart and Kay’s invention of the notion of ‘windows’ for computer graphical user interfaces (read more <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_graphical_user_interface">here</a>). Rectangles are cool.</li>
</ul>

<p>That’s everything pertinent that I can think of for the moment. Sláinte!</p>

    Socrates shows with ease that Cephalus' view of justice is untenable: a man who has taken or received a weapon from a sane man would act unjustly if he returned it to him when he asked for it after having become insane; in the same way one would act unjustly by being resolved to say nothing but the truth to a madman.

    From the far end of the corridor, the mirror was watching us; and we discovered, with the inevitability of discoveries made late at night, that mirrors have something grotesque about them. Then Bioy Casares recalled that one of the heresiarchs of Uqbar had stated that mirrors and copulation are abominable, since they both multiply the numbers of man.

    The gods heard their lament, the gods of heaven cried to the Lord of Uruk, to Anu the god of Uruk: 'A goddess made him, strong as a savage bull, none can withstand his arms. No son is left with his father, for Gilgamesh takes them all; and is this the king, the shepherd of his people? His lust leaves no virgin to her lover, neither the warrior's daughter nor the wife of the noble.' When Anu had heard their lamentation the gods cried to Aruru, the goddess of creation, 'You made him, O Aruru; now create his equal; let it be as like him as his own reflection, his second self; stormy heart for stormy heart. Let them contend together and leave Uruk in quiet.'

    This Lizaveta was a dwarfish creature, "not five foot within a wee bit," as many of the pious old women said pathetically about her, after her death. Her broad, healthy, red face had a look of blank idiocy and the fixed stare in her eyes was unpleasant, in spite of their meek expression. She wandered about, summer and winter alike, barefooted, wearing nothing but a hempen smock. Her coarse, almost black hair curled like lamb's wool, and formed a sort of huge cap on her head. It was always crusted with mud, and had leaves, bits of stick, and shavings clinging to it, as she always slept on the ground and in the dirt. Her father, a homeless, sickly drunkard, called Ilya, had lost everything and lived many years as a workman with some well-to-do tradespeople. Her mother had long been dead. Spiteful and diseased, Ilya used to beat Lizaveta inhumanly whenever she returned to him. But she rarely did so, for every one in the town was ready to look after her as being an idiot, and so specially dear to God.
