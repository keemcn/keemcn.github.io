  <p>The internet is a ghoulish cauldron, made of stainless steel and fueled by alchemy; it overflows with swirling ideas in their many forms. The digital entities of today that pour their ephemeral ideas from small glass flasks into the cauldron are descended from flesh-and-blood entities of the past.</p>

<p>Before the internet, there was a fountain, hewn of marble and fueled by sweat; it was filled with printed and written words. The flesh-and-blood entities of this era painstakingly scrawled their thoughts onto papyrus, slate, and 20 lb paper, then placed them gently, wistfully into the fountain.</p>

<p>The fountain and the cauldron come from the same place - they were created by the same species. Still, they differ.</p>

<p>The flesh-and-blood entities of the fountain era each represented a human being. Upon release, the ideas that these humans had birthed became immediately attached to their flesh-and-blood entities. There was no escape. The word of the entity was the word of the human. Pseudonyms were uncommon, and the famous examples of successful pseudonymous writing are mere aberrations in the vast desert of time. Authors that wished for their ideas and books not to be burned, buried, or besmirched by the ruling regimes of their day had to operate within the confines of those regimes’ Overton windows. For the majority of history, Overton windows were quite small. Because they could not say what they meant, they had to conceal their true ideas and heretically heterodox thoughts between the lines of their works.</p>

<p>Such is the subject of Strauss’ Persecution and the Art of Writing:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>An exoteric book contains then two teachings: a popular teaching of an edifying character, which is in the foreground; and a philosophic teaching concerning the most important subject, which is indicated only between the lines.</p>

  <p>. . .</p>

  <p>It has all the advantages of private communication without having its greatest disadvantage - that it reaches only the writer’s acquaintances. It has all the advantages of public communication without having its greatest disadvantage - capital punishment for the author.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We thank these venerable authors of the past for their forfeiture of clarity in exchange for longevity. If Anaxagoras, Protagoras, Socrates, Plato, Xenophon, Aristotle, Avicenna, Averroes, Maimonides, Grotius, Descartes, Hobbes, Spinoza, Locke, Bayle, Wolff, Montesquieu, Voltaire, Rousseau, Lessing and Kant had not intentionally mired themselves in the muck of obscurantism, their ideas would not have survived to the modern era. Times have changed, though. Moloch’s granite cocks have sprung from the surface of the Earth in abundance, from George Washington’s of yore to Marc Benioff’s of today. The cauldron has been cast. The anonymous has arisen.</p>

<p>When the internet user of today signs into their favored social media platform, they sip on the filthy slime that has collected on the surface of the cauldron’s brew. The nourishing ideas, essays from the deep, have all sunk to the bottom - they are more difficult to retrieve. The alternative identities and anonymous accounts in the age of the cauldron provide the prominent and powerful a place to avoid the public punishment that would threaten to destroy their validity within the societal game they so deftly play. The naked muses of the best and brightest hide among the alts. Their ideas are judged on their own merit. The contest is pure.</p>

<p>Unlike the fountain, the cauldron is apolitical, unbiased, and welcoming. Any who so desire may empty their flasks into it. Any who so desire may sample the brew.</p>

<p>Seek, and ye shall find.</p>

    Socrates shows with ease that Cephalus' view of justice is untenable: a man who has taken or received a weapon from a sane man would act unjustly if he returned it to him when he asked for it after having become insane; in the same way one would act unjustly by being resolved to say nothing but the truth to a madman.

    From the far end of the corridor, the mirror was watching us; and we discovered, with the inevitability of discoveries made late at night, that mirrors have something grotesque about them. Then Bioy Casares recalled that one of the heresiarchs of Uqbar had stated that mirrors and copulation are abominable, since they both multiply the numbers of man.

    The gods heard their lament, the gods of heaven cried to the Lord of Uruk, to Anu the god of Uruk: 'A goddess made him, strong as a savage bull, none can withstand his arms. No son is left with his father, for Gilgamesh takes them all; and is this the king, the shepherd of his people? His lust leaves no virgin to her lover, neither the warrior's daughter nor the wife of the noble.' When Anu had heard their lamentation the gods cried to Aruru, the goddess of creation, 'You made him, O Aruru; now create his equal; let it be as like him as his own reflection, his second self; stormy heart for stormy heart. Let them contend together and leave Uruk in quiet.'

    This Lizaveta was a dwarfish creature, "not five foot within a wee bit," as many of the pious old women said pathetically about her, after her death. Her broad, healthy, red face had a look of blank idiocy and the fixed stare in her eyes was unpleasant, in spite of their meek expression. She wandered about, summer and winter alike, barefooted, wearing nothing but a hempen smock. Her coarse, almost black hair curled like lamb's wool, and formed a sort of huge cap on her head. It was always crusted with mud, and had leaves, bits of stick, and shavings clinging to it, as she always slept on the ground and in the dirt. Her father, a homeless, sickly drunkard, called Ilya, had lost everything and lived many years as a workman with some well-to-do tradespeople. Her mother had long been dead. Spiteful and diseased, Ilya used to beat Lizaveta inhumanly whenever she returned to him. But she rarely did so, for every one in the town was ready to look after her as being an idiot, and so specially dear to God.
