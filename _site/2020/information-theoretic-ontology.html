  <p><em>Note: This post was a failed attempt at formalizing an iffy mental model.

<h2 id="gobbledegook">gobbledegook</h2>
<p>Wow! You actually clicked through on the gobbledegook-filled title of this post! I’m impressed. In case you’re unsure about what those words mean, here’s a brief primer.</p>

<p>The title ‘Towards an Information-Theoretic Ontology’ just means that I think I’ve had a good insight into how the universe works, and that the insight uses concepts that come from Claude Shannon’s theory of information (note: if you haven’t read his <a href="http://people.math.harvard.edu/~ctm/home/text/others/shannon/entropy/entropy.pdf">original paper</a>, I highly recommend it).</p>

<p><em>Information theory</em> is a field of math that deals with how information, broadly conceived, is transmitted and stored. It gives a formal, rigorous way of thinking about bits and how computational devices can use them.</p>

<p>An <em>ontology</em> is just a coherent framework that describes a group of things and how those things interact, but in the most pared-down way possible. To give you some intuition, a good example comes from particle physics: an ontology of particle physics would just be the list of particles and the list of fundamental forces that describe how they interact (we know of 4 such forces so far!). Sure, all of the higher level complexity in the universe is a direct result of those things and their interactions, but paring the complexity down to the pure essentials is part of the exercise of constructing an ontology. I’m also a math nerd, so I’m obligated to mention the obvious connection here to category theory. <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<h2 id="idea">idea</h2>
<p>The core insight is that conscious beings are information processors. We observe finite regions in time of the finite regions in space that are physically close to us, compress the information describing those regions, and store the compressed data in our heads. We can then recall the compressed data, decompress it, and utilize it to think. The goal is to formalize this notion of information processing and use it to build an ontology of the universe.</p>

<h3 id="things">things</h3>
<p>First, we begin with the <em>things</em> in this ontology. The first type of <em>thing</em> that we’re interested in is finite regions in time of finite regions of space. Imagine writing down all of the relevant positions and momenta of all of the subatomic particles that make up the Earth at some slice of time <script type="math/tex">t_{0}</script>. Now imagine you zoom across the galaxy in a ship to some remote, empty corner of space. You also have an army of tiny, atomic-sized workers that can manipulate the positions and momenta of individual subatomic particles, and a machine that can pause time for the rest of the universe (but not for you and your atomic workers). If you had enough workers, enough subatomic particles to build with, and paused time for long enough, you could feed them directions from when you wrote down all of the relevant information about the Earth earlier and perfectly reconstruct the exact original state of the Earth at <script type="math/tex">t_{0}</script>.</p>

<p>That’s cool, but we can go further. It turns out that time is, for all intents and purposes, discrete (the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_time">Planck time</a>, denoted <script type="math/tex">t_{P}</script>), so we now unpause time using our machine, wait one <script type="math/tex">t_{P}</script>, and record the state of the Earth again. If we keep doing this process for all <script type="math/tex">\{t_{0}+nt_{p}, n \in \mathbb{N}\}</script>, we can record everything on Earth until time itself ceases to exist.</p>

<p>But we don’t want to do that for all time – we just want to do that for some finite amount of time. This is to say that we’re only interested in all <script type="math/tex">% <![CDATA[
\{t_{0}+nt_{P}: n \in A \subset \mathbb{N}\ , \vert A \vert < \infty \} %]]></script>. Now that you have the intuition, we can crystallize things a bit. I call a <em>scene</em> a bounded region of space and a perfect, complete record of the relevant characteristics of all of the subatomic particles in that region (type of particle, position, momentum) at a finite number of time slices. Without loss of generality, we can attach the temporal information into this set of ‘relevant characteristics’, and then obtain a set of tuples. So we finally arrive at this quasi-definition. A <em>scene</em> is a set of tuples <script type="math/tex">\{a_{0},\ldots, a_{n}\}</script> where each <script type="math/tex">a_{i}=(v,\vec d,\vec \rho,t_{0}+it_{P})</script>. <script type="math/tex">v</script> is the variety of particle, <script type="math/tex">\vec d</script> is the position vector (quantized to a maximum resolution of the Planck length), and <script type="math/tex">\vec \rho</script> is the momentum vector. Note that the indexing set on the tuples embeds the data about our <script type="math/tex">A</script> from above into the scene. There are certainly some details that I’m skimping out on, but I’m just sketching out a bit of structure in this piece.</p>

<p>Great, so we have the notion of a scene – a perfect record of a region of spacetime…</p>

<h3 id="relations">relations</h3>

<p>There’s a fairly intuitive sense in which watching TV is like looking through a wormhole to the past, but we can add rigor to this notion. Unfortunately, the word ‘wormhole’ is already a well-defined concept in physics, so instead I’ll call this mathematical analogue a <em>tunnel</em>. A <em>tunnel</em> is a tuple <script type="math/tex">(A,B,C,f,g)</script> where <script type="math/tex">A</script> and <script type="math/tex">C</script> are disjoint states of some bounded region of the standard Minkowski spacetime, <script type="math/tex">B</script> is an arbitrary set, <script type="math/tex">f</script> is a compression scheme that maps <script type="math/tex">A \to B</script>, and <script type="math/tex">g</script> is a decompression scheme that maps <script type="math/tex">B \to C</script>. To disambiguate, a disjoint state of some bounded region of the standard Minkowski spacetime is…</p>

<p>Let’s do a sanity check to make sure that the tunnel as defined earlier…</p>

      <p>In math-speak, an ontology is just a category (but with a lot less rigor and elegance in the definition). Like a category, an ontology has two sets – one is a set of <em>objects</em>, and the other is a set of <em>morphisms</em>. At a very high level, the objects are the <em>things</em> you’re interested in, and the morphisms are the <em>ways that those things interact with one another</em>. Some of the more famous categories are Set (objects are sets, morphisms are functions), Grp (objects are groups, morphisms are group homomorphisms), and Top (objects are topological spaces, morphisms are continuous functions between topological spaces). <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>

    Socrates shows with ease that Cephalus' view of justice is untenable: a man who has taken or received a weapon from a sane man would act unjustly if he returned it to him when he asked for it after having become insane; in the same way one would act unjustly by being resolved to say nothing but the truth to a madman.

    From the far end of the corridor, the mirror was watching us; and we discovered, with the inevitability of discoveries made late at night, that mirrors have something grotesque about them. Then Bioy Casares recalled that one of the heresiarchs of Uqbar had stated that mirrors and copulation are abominable, since they both multiply the numbers of man.

    The gods heard their lament, the gods of heaven cried to the Lord of Uruk, to Anu the god of Uruk: 'A goddess made him, strong as a savage bull, none can withstand his arms. No son is left with his father, for Gilgamesh takes them all; and is this the king, the shepherd of his people? His lust leaves no virgin to her lover, neither the warrior's daughter nor the wife of the noble.' When Anu had heard their lamentation the gods cried to Aruru, the goddess of creation, 'You made him, O Aruru; now create his equal; let it be as like him as his own reflection, his second self; stormy heart for stormy heart. Let them contend together and leave Uruk in quiet.'

    This Lizaveta was a dwarfish creature, "not five foot within a wee bit," as many of the pious old women said pathetically about her, after her death. Her broad, healthy, red face had a look of blank idiocy and the fixed stare in her eyes was unpleasant, in spite of their meek expression. She wandered about, summer and winter alike, barefooted, wearing nothing but a hempen smock. Her coarse, almost black hair curled like lamb's wool, and formed a sort of huge cap on her head. It was always crusted with mud, and had leaves, bits of stick, and shavings clinging to it, as she always slept on the ground and in the dirt. Her father, a homeless, sickly drunkard, called Ilya, had lost everything and lived many years as a workman with some well-to-do tradespeople. Her mother had long been dead. Spiteful and diseased, Ilya used to beat Lizaveta inhumanly whenever she returned to him. But she rarely did so, for every one in the town was ready to look after her as being an idiot, and so specially dear to God.
