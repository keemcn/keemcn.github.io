        <title>The illusory stupidity of politicians</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;American media has a long history of portraying politicians, and people of power more generally, as stupid and naive. Saturday Night Live’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JUWSLlz0Fdo&amp;amp;list=PLIMQGnRxY3JH4jtVG5zjmW0Eqqt_jzWSF&quot;&gt;political skits&lt;/a&gt; are wonderful examples of this. SNL has a distinctly liberal lean, and so tends to focus on GOP figures, but there are many examples of analogous media portrayals from the conservative side of the Overton window, too. Articles and TV segments abound from all across the political spectrum that propound the blatant idiocy and plebeian nature of the other side’s figureheads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the media portrayals, are politicians actually stupid and naive? I think the answer is a resounding &lt;em&gt;hell no&lt;/em&gt;. Take someone like Steve Bannon, who has been pilloried by the media (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/01/04/steve-bannon-michael-wolff-book-donald-trump-216243&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.themarysue.com/steve-bannon-stupid-trump-documentary/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and recently &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thedailybeast.com/steve-bannon-has-become-the-one-thing-we-never-thought-hed-be-boring&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). It seems to me that the general characterization of Steve Bannon is as a naive, corrupt, sometimes idiotic, and boring guy. If you’re politically liberal and reading this, I’d guess that you agree (if you don’t, send me an email or a DM!). Now, try to gently put that conception aside for a moment and watch &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH5QzuzD01A&quot;&gt;this video&lt;/a&gt; of him discussing China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I first saw it, I was blown away at how articulate he was and how parsimonious some of his explanations were. Surely there was a mistake. This was &lt;em&gt;Steve Bannon&lt;/em&gt;, a known dumbass, a ‘lying, fascist prick!’ That fool couldn’t possibly be referencing 老百姓 and Chinese political philosophy! He just, you know, spends all day reading the shit that Breitbart writers spew… he, he…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I implore you to try this exercise with any politician you think is stupid or naive (with the exception of Trump – Trump seems to either be (1) a counterexample to this pattern, or (2) secretly intelligent). Try and find a longer interview or piece of writing from the politician that was created during a period when they weren’t in the heyday of their political career. I suspect that you’ll be surprised by their cogency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question then becomes &lt;em&gt;why?&lt;/em&gt; Why are we deluded by the media about the intelligence and ability of our politicians?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One explanation is that it’s just another example of partisan conflict. The powers that be on either side of the political spectrum want their political opposition to seem stupid, naive, weak, etc. so that voters are less inclined to vote for said opposition. While perhaps correct, this is uninteresting. It’s the same story we’ve heard for years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A more interesting question to ask is not just ‘why are we deluded by the media’, but rather &lt;em&gt;why do people eat it up?&lt;/em&gt; The media can propagate whatever messaging it wants, but at some fundamental level, the populace has to swallow what it’s being fed. Various psychological tricks are routinely used to make the act of swallowing easier on us poor bastards, but there must be some degree of deep acceptance of the information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the case of the illusory stupidity of politicians, I’d chalk it up to an innate desire to feel as though one is smarter than one actually is. It’s tempting to believe that you could be doing what the politicians are doing. It’s tempting to tell yourself that if circumstances had been a bit different, if you had really given it a good college try, you could &lt;em&gt;totally&lt;/em&gt; have gotten elected. In the safety of your own head, it’s all too easy to ‘know’ that you’re an expert on the issues that face the nation and the difficulties of becoming an elected official.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Dunning-Kruger effect rears its ugly head here – most Americans simply aren’t conscientious enough to realize that the world of foreign affairs and public policy is extremely difficult to think about and act competently inside of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps most things are like this! &lt;em&gt;Perhaps the world is a bit more complex than how the media portrays it!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Literature as evidence</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;There is a long history of social-scientists using literature as foundational evidence for their ideas and theories. If you want proof of such a claim, go take a look at the now archaic &lt;em&gt;Totem and Taboo&lt;/em&gt; or even the OG &lt;em&gt;Communist Manifesto&lt;/em&gt;. For a more modern version, just crack open &lt;em&gt;Things Hidden since the Foundation of the World&lt;/em&gt;. You’ll be inundated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first, this seems laughable. Literature? As scientific evidence? Aren’t most great works of literature &lt;em&gt;fictional?&lt;/em&gt; How can something fictional possibly be used rigorously?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alas, it cannot! Obviously, one should not use fictional literature as &lt;em&gt;rigorous, scientific&lt;/em&gt; evidence in the sense of ‘providing explicit information about an event or occurrence.’ If I claim that Alice killed Bob (the poor bastard), and then justify my claim by citing a classic Dostoevsky novel where Alice kills Bob (in this hypothetical world, such a novel exists), you’d rightly inform me of my idiocy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As scholars of the humanities and social sciences love to point out, rigorous science isn’t everything. Speaking from experience, this is a hard pill to swallow. Despite the fact that extracting precise scientific value from literature is nearly impossible, literature does have an interesting characteristic that allows for the embedding and subsequent extraction of useful information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The characteristic of which I speak stems from the fact that literature is a subset of books, and books are &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindy_effect&quot;&gt;Lindy&lt;/a&gt;. This means that any literature in the zeitgeist of the current day has survived the cumulative literary scrutiny of all human beings who lived between the publishing of such literature and now. This is an extremely difficult thing to do, which is why we see such a tiny number of pieces of older literature that have maintained their high graces in the cultural tastes of every era since they were published.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a useful trait! We can roughly deduce that old literature that has been in the zeitgeist for a long time encodes something deep about the preferences of human beings. I suspect this is the utility that people like Freud, Marx, and Girard see in it. Analyzing literature is then akin to analyzing a highly-agreed-upon version of human values and preferences, something that is extremely valuable if you’re studying human values and preferences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next time that you encounter a claim that makes use of literature for evidence, do your best to evaluate it while keeping the above characteristic in mind. Social science often seems like useless and obscurantist gobbledegook, but some of the people that operate in this space know what they’re doing, and their ideas are good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sláinte!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A new era of more right</title>
        <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;an-explanation&quot;&gt;an explanation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today is the day that I begin surfacing words from my personal reflection-journal/digital-thought-notebook thing. I have a (sort of) daily cadence of writing in it, because doing so helps me keep my head on straight. If I don’t work through the ambient thoughts in my brain in a systematic way like this, the thoughts either implode into nothingness or explode into existential and epistemic anxiety. Both of those outcomes are bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plus, I tweeted &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/keegan_mcnamara/status/1188337574299013120&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; the other day, so I figured that instead of perpetuating the problems I pointed out, I’d start trying to solve them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A large part of me hates disturbing the former serenity and distilled nature of this website with something as filthy and unkempt as mere &lt;em&gt;thoughts&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;reflections&lt;/em&gt; (the bile bubbles to the back of my throat as I type), but I’ve decided that if there’s any net positive effect on humanity as a result of my making such things public, then I ought to do it. As anyone who has taken an Analysis course knows, net positivity is not difficult to do ( &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;\forall \epsilon &gt; 0,\exists...&lt;/script&gt;), so I think I indeed ought to start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;some-changes&quot;&gt;some changes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d still like there to be features that allow for some semblance of filterability on my writings, so I’ve added a &lt;a href=&quot;https://keeganm.org/categories&quot;&gt;categories&lt;/a&gt; page and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://keeganm.org/tags&quot;&gt;tags&lt;/a&gt; page. Implementing categories and tags from scratch in Jekyll was a bit of a pain in the ass, but I think it’ll be worth it in the longer term. I also have a fair number of thoughts about math and physics-related things, so I added MathJax support (do you even &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;\LaTeX&lt;/script&gt;, bro?) for when I desperately need to reminisce on the days I spent breathing in toxic amounts of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhNUjg9X4g8&quot;&gt;Hagoromo&lt;/a&gt; dust. Again, Jekyll is kind of a pain in the ass to do stuff like this with, but as my good friend Brennie would say, the ‘worth is high’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll be categorizing these more spontaneous thoughts and writings as ‘posts’, as opposed to the far more time-consuming to produce ‘essays’ and ‘videos’. Perhaps someday I’ll gather the courage to put my poetry and prose on here. We’ll see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve also changed the look and feel of the site. More specifically…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I changed the paragraph font to what I consider the most beautiful of all serifs, Libre Baskerville. I previously used Helvetica, which is nice for headings, but miserable to read for long periods of time. Such is the life of a sans.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I removed all of the colors from the site, with the notable exception of salmon (&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff5858;&quot;&gt;#ff5858&lt;/span&gt;). I use the same salmon color on my &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/keegan_mcnamara&quot;&gt;twitter profile&lt;/a&gt;, and I enjoy having a cohesive brand identity in this one, very limited way. I’m also a proponent of design minimalism, which leads me to…&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I thinned out all of the lines used for bounding boxes. This allows the elements on the screen to breathe, and it also focuses attention on the ones that matter. The bounding boxes themselves are actually totally unnecessary, but I like how they demarcate territory and group related elements together. They’re also somewhat of an homage to Engelbart and Kay’s invention of the notion of ‘windows’ for computer graphical user interfaces (read more &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_graphical_user_interface&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). Rectangles are cool.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s everything pertinent that I can think of for the moment. Sláinte!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>My Essay in Palladium Magazine</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I wrote a piece for Palladium about the video game industry, the increasingly exploitative tools it uses to gain/retain users, and why we need change.

        <title>Sport and Invisible Propaganda</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;You know the feeling. You’re at the stadium, the anthem is being sung while a wounded veteran is paraded around next to the professional players. Tears well in your eyes, and it’s as though a balloon filled with liquid pride is gradually expanding in your upper abdomen. It’s incredibly unique – I, frankly, can’t think of more than a handful of instances wherein such a deep appreciation and sense of pride can be brought about in myself as if due to the flip of a switch. But why? Why does every American who’s ever seen a professional sports event know this feeling so vividly and experience it so intensely?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Noam Chomsky would probably turn to his propaganda model of media for an explanation. In its essence, Chomsky would say, the media’s primary purpose is as a tool to indoctrinate and suppress the masses. Prima facie, perhaps that claim sounds like just another academic spewing some “goddamned anti-American garbage.” But consider for a moment the perspective of a Martian peering down on America from outer space. This Martian would see a truly remarkable concentration of power and wealth within the government and the largest corporations. It seems to follow immediately that because humans are greedy creatures, those entities that control the vast majority of power and wealth in the US would want to continue to control that power and wealth. So then, as the astute Martian would point out, it makes perfect sense that those institutions would utilize a significant amount of the vast resources at their disposal to maintain their respective stakes. Well, as it were, some of the largest companies in the US are media companies. In addition to huge sums of capital, they control massive information distribution networks (e.g. TV, radio, social media, etc…), and the Martian would see that those networks and that capital were being appropriated to mold the public’s conception of the world away from the reality of corporate and governmental fascism and instead inculcate them with docility in order to maintain the status quo of power and wealth. What’s frightening about Chomsky’s model is that it’s coldly rational, unbiased politically, and posits that the existence of the propagandistic media is merely an emergent property of the concentrations of wealth that arise in capitalistic societies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through this lens, let’s take a deeper look at the culture of sports in modern society. Consider a relatively simple question that actually cuts quite deeply into the issue – why are athletes in the NFL paid so much money? Well, perhaps the prima facie answer is that they’re just extremely well qualified on a physical basis, and therefore deserving of special pay. Consider though that professional marathon runners, who are extremely well qualified on a physical basis (perhaps even moreso than NFL players), make vastly less money than NFL players. For example, Tamirat Tola, a 2016 Olympic Bronze medalist from Ethiopia, made a paltry $93,750 in 2018, while Jimmy Garropolo, the QB for the San Francisco 49ers, made $43,100,000. Physical qualification can’t be the answer. However, things become clear when you look at how much sponsorship money is being spent on each sport, and from who that money is coming. The NFL’s sponsorship revenue totaled $1.32 Billion in the 2017-2018 season, while the Professional Road Running Organization’s (PRRO) total prize money available for the 2018 season was a mere $330,000. The NFL’s sponsors are companies like Anheuser-Busch, Castrol, PepsiCo, and Frito-Lay, whereas the PRRO’s sponsors are companies like Publix (a grocery-store chain) and a small credit union in Washington DC. The NFL players are making more money because there’s a helluva lot more institutional money being poured into their market. The natural question to ask then is this: why aren’t companies like Anheuser-Busch and PepsiCo sponsoring the PRRO circuit? Well, it’s because the American public isn’t watching televised marathons – they’re watching their favorite NFL, MLB, NHL, and NBA teams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People put a pretty astonishingly large amount of time and mental resources into sports. If you ask your next-door neighbor how your local NFL team is doing, you’re likely to get an extremely articulate and complex response that takes into account the abilities of individual players, the coaching staff’s play calling decisions, the player trading market, etc… They’re probably going to cite specific statistics and be able to discuss intricacies that required hours of observation, research, and thought. And it makes sense – in our society, there are things that people can use their intelligence on, take politics for example, but most can’t really get involved in those things in any meaningful way. So instead, they spend their intelligence on other things that are cognitively intensive, yet also accessible – things like spectator sports. Sports intensely occupy the minds of a vast majority of the population and diffuse a huge amount of latent time and intellectual capacity, which is precisely what the corporate and governmental entities that control the majority of power and wealth would want. So it’s quite natural that companies like Anheuser-Busch and PepsiCo are sponsoring the big spectator sports associations – those associations are doing a wonderful thing in the eyes of such companies. They’re efficiently squandering the time and cognitive effort of the broader populace that could otherwise be used to gain a deeper understanding of reality and potentially organize to bring about change in the upper echelons of power. Furthermore, it makes total sense that the armed forces show up, parade around veterans, and hold subtly nationalist ceremonies – they’re the grandaddy of the entities that have a vested interest in supporting such a quiescence of the broader populace. In an attempt to not inflame passions, I’ll leave that discussion to Chomsky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let’s return to our initial situation. You’re watching your favorite team play, and you rise for the national anthem. Your heart swells with pride as the talented singer belts the anthem alongside a wounded veteran. With our newfound understanding, though, the sentiment of that situation changes. Spectator sports enforce jingoism, promote consumerism, and indoctrinate an impressionable society to maintain the status quo of power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think before you buy that ticket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peace.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Only Reason College Prestige Matters</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Harvard. Stanford. MIT. Princeton. Yale. Northwestern. Johns Hopkins. UChicago. Berkeley. Columbia. Dartmouth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are all names that bring about strong emotions in most people. For some, those emotions are jealousy, anger, and disdain. For most others, they’re prestige, respect, and mystique.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But why do such institutions hold such high places in our hearts and minds? Why do we value graduates of that set of prestigious schools so much more than all of the others?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it’s solely because it’s hard to get in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know that when I’m looking at someone’s LinkedIn profile or resume, the biggest “wow!” factor is a degree from a prestigious institution. And the reason I’ve come up with to explain &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; is not at all because of the things that they’ve learned while walking the hallowed halls of such places — anecdotally, the content and quality of an education varies very little within US colleges. Calc 3 at Stanford is pretty damn similar to Calc 3 at The University of Georgia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, the degree indicates to me that the person was given a stamp of approval by one of the most difficult, rigorous filtering processes that the world has to offer — the admissions committee. Any Stanford freshman in this year’s class of 2022 was among only 4.36% of students to be accepted. Read that one more time. &lt;strong&gt;Four point three six percent.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sum total of a student’s entire life, both academic and otherwise, was evaluated by a brutally harsh committee of Stanford gatekeepers, and that student was let in. Those gatekeepers pored over every detail on that person’s admission profile and thought that they stood out among &lt;strong&gt;47,451&lt;/strong&gt; applicants. That’s remarkable, and indicates an immense amount of skill, dedication, and tenacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, it means they were a badass early on in their lives. Whether it was through parental pressures, natural talent, or whatever else, they pursued and achieved incredible things while they were less than ~18 years old. It’s &lt;em&gt;guaranteed&lt;/em&gt; that they did. And that’s why it’s valuable when I see it on a resume.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In doing this, I’m essentially just bootstrapping the sum total expertise and experience of those admissions committees and leveraging it to make a more informed opinion of a person. The probability that someone who has demonstrated badassery to the degree needed to get into an elite school will go on to continue demonstrating badassery thereafter (in any given area of their life) is &lt;em&gt;far&lt;/em&gt; higher than the probability that someone who graduated from community college after dropping out of high school will do the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find this explanation to be deeply satisfying— it explains why I hold MIT drop-outs in the same raw intellectual talent regard as I hold people who spent the full 4 years at MIT. It explains why I hold Dartmouth graduates from the 70’s in far lower raw talent regard than the Dartmouth freshmen of today. It explains why I hold Harvard undergrads who go on to PhD programs at CU Boulder in higher talent regard than CU Boulder undergrads who go on to PhD programs at Harvard. And most of all, it explains why people who list Stanford as their education on LinkedIn after completing an online course on Udacity or Coursera are not impressive to me &lt;em&gt;whatsoever&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my evaluation, it’s all about leveraging the effort, research, and expertise of the admissions councils in order to establish a base confidence in the likelihood of a given person to be a badass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This outlook is the most effective in the case where I’m considering people who are either currently enrolled in college or are recent graduates/drop outs. From there on out, where they went doesn’t matter as much as what they ended up doing for work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is best shown with an example. If Jill went to Yale but then worked for Deloitte for 10 years and did nothing of interest except earn one promotion, Jill is not a badass (in my book). If Joe went to Washington State but then worked for Google as a Software Engineer for 2 years and started 3 companies, one of which failed, one of which was sold for 200mm, and one of which was acquihired by Microsoft, I no longer care that he went to Washington State — he’s sufficiently demonstrated his badassery to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And while it’s totally feasible for edge cases to occur on both sides of the spectrum, telling ourselves romantic stories about them leads to false general perceptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take one of my good friends from high school who was incredibly intelligent and an undeniable badass, but was denied admission at the Ivies he applied to. He ended up going to CU Boulder. Just because of this edge case, we shouldn’t tell ourselves a false narrative that CU Boulder graduates are as competent on average as MIT graduates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other end, take a guy I met this past summer who was undoubtedly dumb. He had extremely poor technical abilities, didn’t learn quickly, and couldn’t communicate his thoughts in an effective way. He’s a Junior at Princeton. Just because of this edge case, we shouldn’t tell ourselves a false narrative that Princeton graduates are as competent on average as UMass Amherst graduates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a tough pill to swallow as a college student at a less prestigious school. It means that you’ll likely have a more difficult time getting started in your professional career. Remember that all hope is not lost, however. If you can prove yourself by doing incredible things and persevering through the ‘prestige gap’, you can surpass anyone that may have come out of an Ivy league school or other top ranked institution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Likewise, if you’re a college student at a prestigious school, you have a leg up out of the gates. But if you squander your career pursuing unimpressive, safe, or boring opportunities, you’ll lose your lead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Either way, it’s most important &lt;em&gt;by far&lt;/em&gt; to take risks and do cool things. The majority of your life is spent &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; in college, so make it count.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peace.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Savor the Cereal</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;When I was younger, I wasn’t an awesome human being. I didn’t try very hard in any of my classes, I played too many video games, I didn’t read enough, I ate like shit, and I exercised only when I felt so disgusted with myself that it felt like a fucking moral imperative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to unearth my true potential, but I also knew that there wasn’t an ice cube’s chance in hell of that potential being actualized unless I changed my life in a really fundamental way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That way came through reading. I forced myself to read 14 books in 2 weeks while working full-time at Amazon, and I learned some cool shit from some great writers like Atul Gawande, Nick Bostrom, and Ray Dalio. The books I read collectively sparked in me a deep-seated desire to re-evaluate my life and create a framework for self improvement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That framework manifested itself in an increased drive to do certain thing and undergo periods of harsh self-reflection that then informed plans to create a rigorous routine of hard work and discipline. It also manifested itself in an increased need to consume ideas and thoughts in the form of reading books, Medium articles, blog posts, and Quora answers, watching terrific thought-pieces on YouTube, great documentaries on Netflix, and awesome short-films on Vimeo, and listening to podcasts from some of the great thinkers of our time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It. Was. Fucking. Incessant. I spent damn near every waking minute consuming thoughts and ideas. Podcasts for breakfast, Podcasts while I was driving (one earbud out for safety!), YouTube videos during my lunch break, Medium articles as a mental break from coding, and documentaries late at night when I couldn’t focus anymore. I devoured media &lt;em&gt;voraciously.&lt;/em&gt; And this was the “good” media, too. The kind that everyone and their mother tells you to consume instead of the shitty news updates you see on Snapchat, Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. I used said apps for a combined 10 minutes a day, just to make sure I wasn’t missing out on the US being bombed or some similarly important, historic event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought I was doing great — being aware and motivated towards self improvement wasn’t the norm for people my age. I felt like I was succeeding in a culture where it was all too common to spend day after day drinking from the endless dopamine-fountain that is social media. But for some reason, at the end of every day, I felt just as empty as when I woke up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This went on for some time, before I finally realized that I wasn’t &lt;em&gt;being.&lt;/em&gt; I was constantly in the &lt;strong&gt;on&lt;/strong&gt; position — thinking, reading, wondering, journaling, making note of the things that I was learning, engaging with people, etc…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not once did I stop. Not once did I &lt;em&gt;smell the goddamn roses&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the next day, instead of listening to the new Sam Harris podcast while I scarfed down some cereal in an effort to get to the gym on schedule for my daily routine, I put my phone away and &lt;em&gt;just ate the fucking cereal&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of pondering the ethics of honor culture while listening to the eloquent neuroscience PhD talk on 1.5x speed, I slowed down and tasted every single bite of that bowl of Honey Bunches of Oats that went into my mouth. Every delectable calorie that lay in the bowl below me was appreciated as it crossed my palate and subsequently slid down my gullet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you ever realized that Honey Bunches of Oats is mostly just Corn Flakes and Frosted Flakes mixed together in an orgy of carbs? I sure as shit know that I hadn’t prior to that fateful morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was &lt;em&gt;magical&lt;/em&gt; to slow down, be present in the moment, and be aware of how amazing the most mundane stuff in our lives is. I mean, it was &lt;em&gt;cereal&lt;/em&gt; for chrissakes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ever since then, I’ve made sure that I take the time every day to stop being so constantly &lt;strong&gt;on&lt;/strong&gt; and slow down to realize the wonderment that can be seen in every nook and cranny of ordinary being. &lt;strong&gt;That&lt;/strong&gt; is what has made me a better person and realize my potential in a fuller manner. No amount of podcasts, books, or thought-pieces can help you see the miraculous nature of everything we do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consuming is not being.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Savor the cereal.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peace.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Absurdly Subtle Art of Picking a Place to Eat</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;…it’s already noon?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ah, the lunch break. The ubiquitously celebrated opportunity to devour a few delectably taste-filled calories prior to returning to a 9–5 job is a daily occurrence that most employees look forward to with total and utter delight — until, of course, one realizes that one must &lt;em&gt;decide&lt;/em&gt; on a place to stuff one’s face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, to make the situation even more complex, one must decide how to please a whole group’s abundance of different culinary preferences in one fell swoop. The task becomes increasingly difficult with each additional coworker, family member, or friend added into the fray.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all know the feeling of heading out of the office with 3 or 4 coworkers in tow, trying to kindly, yet efficiently, figure out where to go eat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Susan likes Mexican food, maybe we’ll go to Chipotle? But their food has so much salt, and Mary’s been trying to cut back recently. Brian says he’s up for whatevs, but I know he’s trying to be polite and actually loves Indian. What’s the name of that new Hawaiian place? Dammit! Maybe we should just go to McDonald’s…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The amount of latent time that I spend every week on the problem of deciding where to consume food and what to eat when I arrive at a given establishment quite frankly pisses me off, and I think it’s indicative of a far deeper and more difficult problem in American society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eating is something that nearly every living organism needs to do to survive. Luckily for us humans, it’s superbly easy in this day and age to maintain a balanced, healthy diet (provided you’re one of the lucky ones that can afford food). Grocery stores and restaurants are plentiful, and with a meager amount of cash, almost anyone can go grab quality sustenance. So why, then, do we struggle so much with making decisions on what to consume? I posit that it’s because we possess &lt;em&gt;preferences.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Preferences make things hard. They transform an essentially solved problem (eating healthy food) to an extremely difficult, continually evolving unsolved problem (eating food that aligns with individual or group preferences). To illustrate, I’ll give you a scenario.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m Bill. I want to be healthier, so I found a diet plan online that tells me precisely what to eat, when to eat it, and how much it will cost per week. I’m psyched about this new plan and its potential to transform my life, so I excitedly rush out the door and over to the nearest Whole Foods. As I roll my cart down Aisle 2 to grab the first item on my list (superfood-hyper-organic-ultra-non-gmo-delicious protein bars), I glance at the vast array of artistically-packaged boxes and acquire my target. But right next to it is an identically priced box of bars that have more grams of protein per serving, fewer carbs, AND are chocolate-flavored. I adore chocolate. Maybe I oughtta buy those instead?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I end up sitting in the protein bar aisle for the next 10 minutes, attempting to figure out which bars are precisely the best, when in reality I would enjoy &amp;gt;70% of those available. I finally decide on a lucky contestant, and then move onto the next item on my grocery list of 27.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bill is so &lt;em&gt;clearly&lt;/em&gt; a time-wasting fool, yet this behavior is something that I would guess damn near every single person reading this has done. The deeper, more underlying problem that has surfaced in the most benign of forms is that of completely and totally undervaluing time in order to achieve a greater alignment between one’s preferences and one’s decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same thing happens when you and your coworkers are deciding where to eat, or when you’re picking which Netflix show to watch, or which pair of shoes to buy on Amazon. You don’t think about it in the heat of the moment, but the vast majority of restaurants available will have some satisfactory dish for every person in your group, Netflix has an algorithm designed to automatically deliver you the content that you will enjoy most when you go on their website or app, and Amazon has a vetting system that ensures you only see the best of the best products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But… we’re still operating under the assumption that’s it’s a good thing to align one’s preferences and one’s decisions — I think that’s a poor assumption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s say that you end up randomly choosing a crappy restaurant, or you watch a show or read a post that doesn’t jive with your normal preferences. It’s easy to overlook the fact that you’ve presented yourself with an opportunity to grow. Growth is induced by undergoing small bouts of stress, and always doing what you already know you’ll enjoy is certain to result in personal stagnation and boredom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps you’ll fall in love with the eel sushi at the restaurant you randomly chose, will be inspired to become an entrepreneur after watching a terrific documentary you clicked willy-nilly on the front page of your Netflix account, or will lose 20 lbs through a newfound adoration with running in the minimalist running shoes you haphazardly picked out on Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We consistently undervalue the time we spend deciding, underestimate the amount of satisfactory options available, and overvalue the pleasure of an experience that aligns well with our preferences. This brings about a slew of instances wherein we waste an absurd amount of time attempting to figure out ‘which one’ when we would, in reality, be satisfied by most, and likely grow in the instances in which we aren’t satisfied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spend less time choosing, and you’ll be rewarded with more time experiencing and growing.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peace!&lt;/p&gt;
