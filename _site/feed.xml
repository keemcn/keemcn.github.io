        <title>failed {Towards an Information-Theoretic Ontology}</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: This post was a failed attempt at formalizing an iffy mental model. I realized that I don’t have the necessary physics background to be able to confidently say the things I tried outlining below. This is an incomplete, somewhat ugly agglomeration of ideas. Proceed at your own risk.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;gobbledegook&quot;&gt;gobbledegook&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow! You actually clicked through on the gobbledegook-filled title of this post! I’m impressed. In case you’re unsure about what those words mean, here’s a brief primer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The title ‘Towards an Information-Theoretic Ontology’ just means that I think I’ve had a good insight into how the universe works, and that the insight uses concepts that come from Claude Shannon’s theory of information (note: if you haven’t read his &lt;a href=&quot;http://people.math.harvard.edu/~ctm/home/text/others/shannon/entropy/entropy.pdf&quot;&gt;original paper&lt;/a&gt;, I highly recommend it).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Information theory&lt;/em&gt; is a field of math that deals with how information, broadly conceived, is transmitted and stored. It gives a formal, rigorous way of thinking about bits and how computational devices can use them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An &lt;em&gt;ontology&lt;/em&gt; is just a coherent framework that describes a group of things and how those things interact, but in the most pared-down way possible. To give you some intuition, a good example comes from particle physics: an ontology of particle physics would just be the list of particles and the list of fundamental forces that describe how they interact (we know of 4 such forces so far!). Sure, all of the higher level complexity in the universe is a direct result of those things and their interactions, but paring the complexity down to the pure essentials is part of the exercise of constructing an ontology. I’m also a math nerd, so I’m obligated to mention the obvious connection here to category theory. &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;idea&quot;&gt;idea&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The core insight is that conscious beings are information processors. We observe finite regions in time of the finite regions in space that are physically close to us, compress the information describing those regions, and store the compressed data in our heads. We can then recall the compressed data, decompress it, and utilize it to think. The goal is to formalize this notion of information processing and use it to build an ontology of the universe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;things&quot;&gt;things&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we begin with the &lt;em&gt;things&lt;/em&gt; in this ontology. The first type of &lt;em&gt;thing&lt;/em&gt; that we’re interested in is finite regions in time of finite regions of space. Imagine writing down all of the relevant positions and momenta of all of the subatomic particles that make up the Earth at some slice of time &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;t_{0}&lt;/script&gt;. Now imagine you zoom across the galaxy in a ship to some remote, empty corner of space. You also have an army of tiny, atomic-sized workers that can manipulate the positions and momenta of individual subatomic particles, and a machine that can pause time for the rest of the universe (but not for you and your atomic workers). If you had enough workers, enough subatomic particles to build with, and paused time for long enough, you could feed them directions from when you wrote down all of the relevant information about the Earth earlier and perfectly reconstruct the exact original state of the Earth at &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;t_{0}&lt;/script&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s cool, but we can go further. It turns out that time is, for all intents and purposes, discrete (the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_time&quot;&gt;Planck time&lt;/a&gt;, denoted &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;t_{P}&lt;/script&gt;), so we now unpause time using our machine, wait one &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;t_{P}&lt;/script&gt;, and record the state of the Earth again. If we keep doing this process for all &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;\{t_{0}+nt_{p}, n \in \mathbb{N}\}&lt;/script&gt;, we can record everything on Earth until time itself ceases to exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we don’t want to do that for all time – we just want to do that for some finite amount of time. This is to say that we’re only interested in all &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;% &lt;![CDATA[
\{t_{0}+nt_{P}: n \in A \subset \mathbb{N}\ , \vert A \vert &lt; \infty \} %]]&gt;&lt;/script&gt;. Now that you have the intuition, we can crystallize things a bit. I call a &lt;em&gt;scene&lt;/em&gt; a bounded region of space and a perfect, complete record of the relevant characteristics of all of the subatomic particles in that region (type of particle, position, momentum) at a finite number of time slices. Without loss of generality, we can attach the temporal information into this set of ‘relevant characteristics’, and then obtain a set of tuples. So we finally arrive at this quasi-definition. A &lt;em&gt;scene&lt;/em&gt; is a set of tuples &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;\{a_{0},\ldots, a_{n}\}&lt;/script&gt; where each &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;a_{i}=(v,\vec d,\vec \rho,t_{0}+it_{P})&lt;/script&gt;. &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;v&lt;/script&gt; is the variety of particle, &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;\vec d&lt;/script&gt; is the position vector (quantized to a maximum resolution of the Planck length), and &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;\vec \rho&lt;/script&gt; is the momentum vector. Note that the indexing set on the tuples embeds the data about our &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;A&lt;/script&gt; from above into the scene. There are certainly some details that I’m skimping out on, but I’m just sketching out a bit of structure in this piece.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great, so we have the notion of a scene – a perfect record of a region of spacetime…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;relations&quot;&gt;relations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a fairly intuitive sense in which watching TV is like looking through a wormhole to the past, but we can add rigor to this notion. Unfortunately, the word ‘wormhole’ is already a well-defined concept in physics, so instead I’ll call this mathematical analogue a &lt;em&gt;tunnel&lt;/em&gt;. A &lt;em&gt;tunnel&lt;/em&gt; is a tuple &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;(A,B,C,f,g)&lt;/script&gt; where &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;A&lt;/script&gt; and &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;C&lt;/script&gt; are disjoint states of some bounded region of the standard Minkowski spacetime, &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;B&lt;/script&gt; is an arbitrary set, &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;f&lt;/script&gt; is a compression scheme that maps &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;A \to B&lt;/script&gt;, and &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;g&lt;/script&gt; is a decompression scheme that maps &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;B \to C&lt;/script&gt;. To disambiguate, a disjoint state of some bounded region of the standard Minkowski spacetime is…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s do a sanity check to make sure that the tunnel as defined earlier…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In math-speak, an ontology is just a category (but with a lot less rigor and elegance in the definition). Like a category, an ontology has two sets – one is a set of &lt;em&gt;objects&lt;/em&gt;, and the other is a set of &lt;em&gt;morphisms&lt;/em&gt;. At a very high level, the objects are the &lt;em&gt;things&lt;/em&gt; you’re interested in, and the morphisms are the &lt;em&gt;ways that those things interact with one another&lt;/em&gt;. Some of the more famous categories are Set (objects are sets, morphisms are functions), Grp (objects are groups, morphisms are group homomorphisms), and Top (objects are topological spaces, morphisms are continuous functions between topological spaces). &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>Quora postmortem</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I spent a few months last year trying to see how efficiently I could game the website &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quora.com/&quot;&gt;Quora&lt;/a&gt; – the goal was to gain a large amount of followers and views in a very short amount of time. My efforts were rather successful, and this is an analysis of how that happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;stats&quot;&gt;stats&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a starting point, here are the four core stats from my Quora profile at the time of this post’s writing (screenshots included for a dash of verifiability).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Followers: 1,444&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Content Views: 1,100,000&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Content Upvotes: 15,000&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Answers: 49&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../images/quora-post-mortem/img1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;../images/quora-post-mortem/img2.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The total number of content views divided by number of answers is a useful metric for measuring the efficiency of a writer’s growth on Quora. My averaged growth rate is 22,000 views/answer. For context, here are the averaged growth rates for some other successful Quora writers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quora.com/profile/Alon-Amit/answers&quot;&gt;Alon Amit&lt;/a&gt;: 13,171 views/answer&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quora.com/profile/H%C3%A5kon-Hapnes-Strand&quot;&gt;Hakon Hapnes Strand&lt;/a&gt;: 9,003 views/answer&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quora.com/profile/Daniel-McLaury&quot;&gt;Daniel McLaury&lt;/a&gt;: 3,339 views/answer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interpret the relative differences how you may, but I consider my efforts to be quite successful from a statistical perspective. When you consider that there are usually increasing returns to scale as you write more answers (i.e. your 1,000th answer will get more views than your 100th), it’s even more surprising that I was able to do far better per post than those highly successful writers &lt;em&gt;with a paltry 49 answers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a more modest baseline, here are the averaged growth rates of some other Quorans who have roughly the same number of content views as me and answer questions about similar topics:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quora.com/profile/Melissa-Dalis&quot;&gt;Melissa Dalis&lt;/a&gt;: 7,777 views/answer&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quora.com/profile/Chia-Jeng-Yang-%E8%B0%A2%E5%BE%81%E9%98%B3&quot;&gt;Chia Jeng Yang&lt;/a&gt;: 5,882 views/answer&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quora.com/profile/Steven-Schmatz&quot;&gt;Steven Schmatz&lt;/a&gt;: 4,140 views/answer&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quora.com/profile/Jaime-Potter-1&quot;&gt;Jaime Potter&lt;/a&gt;: 3,836 views/answer&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quora.com/profile/Patrick-Dugan-3&quot;&gt;Patrick Dugan&lt;/a&gt;: 3,500 views/answer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compared to this peer group, I did much better. Here’s how it happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;story&quot;&gt;story&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most common behavior on social media sites is called &lt;em&gt;lurking&lt;/em&gt;. Lurking is mere consumption, i.e. consumption without production. Users that lurk are, appropriately, called &lt;em&gt;lurkers&lt;/em&gt;. On Quora, lurking means viewing and upvoting answers but not writing any yourself. On Twitter, lurking means viewing and liking tweets but never sending any tweets yourself. On YouTube, lurking means viewing and commenting on videos without making any videos yourself. Such users are easily identified by having a high ratio of people whose content they consume vs. people who consume their content. You definitely know the type, because most users on most platforms are lurkers. They’re the commoners in online societies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the ruling class in online societies is made up of &lt;em&gt;creators.&lt;/em&gt; Creators are the people who engage with the platform by making stuff. On Quora, this means actually answering questions. On Twitter, this means actually tweeting. On YouTube, this means actually making videos. Creators are rare, and only a small percentage of lurkers will ever transition to become creators. Creating is difficult, because it’s generally very discouraging at the outset. You post a few things that you spent a lot of time making, no one engages with them, and you feel bad. Going through this loop a few times is enough to discourage most people from continuing  their efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was a lurker on Quora for about a year, and then I started seeing answers from an absolute savant-level physics/math genius that was a few years younger than me (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quora.com/profile/Zane-Jakobs&quot;&gt;Zane Jakobs&lt;/a&gt;, he goes to CU Boulder and is now a friend of mine). I thought that if this &lt;em&gt;kid&lt;/em&gt; could get a bunch of followers, then surely I could too. Instead of just mindlessly posting into the void though, I developed a strategy. I had a rough idea of how social media platforms worked, and I thought that if I wrote answers to the right questions in the right way, I could probably grow at least an order of magnitude faster than Zane. This turned out to be correct – Zane’s averaged growth rate is 1,332 views/answer and mine is 22,000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first important thing I discovered about Quora was that its user base is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quora.com/What-s-the-latest-geographic-distribution-of-Quora-users&quot;&gt;largely from India&lt;/a&gt;, and Indians are &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; tech literate. Their system of technical colleges is among the most prestigious and difficult to get into in the world (the IITs are &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; well-reputed in American academia), and an outsized proportion of Indians study engineering and the various ‘hard’ sciences. A large proportion of the employees at major tech companies are from India. This is totally a sweeping generalization, but from what I observed, those facts meant that they were prestige-junkies of the same level as Americans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, I knew there was really only one obvious way of moving forward – to heavily utilize the tech status I had accumulated from my internships at Amazon. I soon discovered that similarly to America, Amazon is an extremely high-status employer in India. There’s a large amount of reverence for people that work there. So, I started answering questions about working as a data scientist for Amazon. They netted me an unbelievable amount of upvotes (5.9k &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quora.com/What-is-it-like-to-be-a-data-scientist-at-Amazon&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, 1k &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quora.com/What-was-your-highest-point-as-a-data-scientist&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and 528 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quora.com/How-common-is-elitism-at-top-software-companies-such-as-Google-Facebook-Netflix-and-Amazon&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), so I just kept on answering more and more questions about working as a data scientist for Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The algorithm promoted the hell out of my answers, and that’s basically the whole story. I tried to be smart about not picking questions that had answers which were already clear winners (i.e. had a bunch of upvotes), but the bulk of the explanation is that I figured out who the primary users of Quora were, did some preliminary psychological analysis on their behavioral tendencies, and wrote exclusively to cater to those tendencies. As you saw from the statistics, it worked like a charm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;slime&quot;&gt;slime&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This obviously feels a bit, idunno, &lt;em&gt;slimy?&lt;/em&gt; It feels sorta slimy in the same way that it feels sorta slimy when someone approaches you while you’re walking down the street and they get you to sign a petition for something that you know nothing about. It’s manipulative, but only slightly? It’s hard to put a pin on exactly what’s weird here, but it definitely puts my sensor in the &lt;em&gt;direction&lt;/em&gt; of wrong. This is why I don’t do it anymore. It was a sort of fun, mostly-harmless little social exercise, but doing it for years on end instead of a few months would be plainly gross.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, it’s interesting to see how easily a motivated actor can use these social media platforms to their advantage. Imagine if I had &lt;em&gt;zero&lt;/em&gt; moral compass, or even worse, a profit motive that compelled me to act like a totally subversive piece of shit – this is sort of what I imagine is happening everyday on most social media platforms. If I wanted to, I could easily spin up a fake profile on Facebook or Twitter or Quora and infiltrate basically any circle of people that I wanted to. Indeed, I happen to know a fairly prominent account on tech/VC Twitter that’s totally fake! The person who runs it does so purely to mess with bad actors in the space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another point I’d like to make is that most people don’t utilize the status and knowledge that they’ve accumulated to the extent that they could. The smartest college graduates in the world every year go into finance, consulting, and tech. They make good salaries while working on some of the most mundane problems the world has to offer. That Harvard degree you just got? How about instead of competing to climb the same ladder as 10,000 of your peers, try and figure out novel ways to exploit what you’ve earned! It’s a travesty to me that the default mode in modern American society is to blindly follow in the footsteps of others. Everyday, scores of students and adults march, lockstep, into the cave. They become so enamored by the beautiful images on the walls that they never dare to leave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I dare you to break that spell.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Graphs from scratch</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;math-education-is-tragic&quot;&gt;Math education is tragic&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most people despise math. They remember being forced to do arithmetic by hand in elementary school, algebra by hand in middle school, and (sometimes) calculus by hand in high school. They lament the inability to use a calculator when it’s &lt;em&gt;clearly&lt;/em&gt; always going to be possible to do so in ‘real life’. It is an absolute travesty that this process of low-utility algorithmic memorization is what the word ‘mathematics’ has come to mean in the minds of people all around the world. It has deprived billions of people from grasping the inherent beauty in pondering things that humans can &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; to be true. When done correctly and in the right domain, reductionist reasoning allows one to perceive the numinous in the purest form that the universe can offer it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This problem with math education, of course, has been noted by people both better at math and better at writing than I. The best explanation of it that I’ve found is &lt;em&gt;A Mathematician’s Lament&lt;/em&gt; by Paul Lockhart (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.maa.org/external_archive/devlin/LockhartsLament.pdf&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;). I recommend you read the whole thing, but this excerpt is particularly salient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Standard School Mathematics Curriculum&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LOWER SCHOOL MATH. The indoctrination begins. Students learn that mathematics is not
something you do, but something that is done to you. Emphasis is placed on sitting still, filling
out worksheets, and following directions. Children are expected to master a complex set of
algorithms for manipulating Hindi symbols, unrelated to any real desire or curiosity on their part,
and regarded only a few centuries ago as too difficult for the average adult. Multiplication tables
are stressed, as are parents, teachers, and the kids themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MIDDLE SCHOOL MATH. Students are taught to view mathematics as a set of procedures,
akin to religious rites, which are eternal and set in stone. The holy tablets, or “Math Books,” are
handed out, and the students learn to address the church elders as “they” (as in “What do they
want here? Do they want me to divide?”) Contrived and artificial “word problems” will be
introduced in order to make the mindless drudgery of arithmetic seem enjoyable by comparison.
Students will be tested on a wide array of unnecessary technical terms, such as ‘whole number’
and ‘proper fraction,’ without the slightest rationale for making such distinctions. Excellent
preparation for Algebra I.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ALGEBRA I. So as not to waste valuable time thinking about numbers and their patterns, this
course instead focuses on symbols and rules for their manipulation. The smooth narrative thread
that leads from ancient Mesopotamian tablet problems to the high art of the Renaissance
algebraists is discarded in favor of a disturbingly fractured, post-modern retelling with no
characters, plot, or theme. The insistence that all numbers and expressions be put into various
standard forms will provide additional confusion as to the meaning of identity and equality.
Students must also memorize the quadratic formula for some reason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is such breathtaking depth and heartbreaking beauty in this ancient art form. How
ironic that people dismiss mathematics as the antithesis of creativity. They are missing out on an
art form older than any book, more profound than any poem, and more abstract than any abstract.
And it is school that has done this! What a sad endless cycle of innocent teachers inflicting
damage upon innocent students. We could all be having so much more fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope that you sympathize with everyone that has undergone the experience Lockhart describes. It’s brutalizing. It’s soul-crushing. It’s sickening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily, I studied math in college and was able to go beyond the layers of nonsense that were piled upon me by the K-12 educational system. I now understand that math is gorgeous, and I understand why people devote their entire lives to studying it. However, most people &lt;em&gt;don’t&lt;/em&gt; understand, so I want to give a glimpse of the beauty that I speak of. To do so, we must begin from scratch.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;graphs-from-scratch&quot;&gt;Graphs from scratch&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine drawing a dot on the screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../images/graphs-from-scratch/img1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;300px&quot; width=&quot;300px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, imagine drawing another dot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../images/graphs-from-scratch/img2.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;300px&quot; width=&quot;300px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now a whole bunch more dots!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../images/graphs-from-scratch/img3.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;300px&quot; width=&quot;300px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, so we’ve got a bunch of individual dots, all hanging out in 2-dimensional space. Let’s start connecting them while making sure that every dot is connected to at least one other dot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../images/graphs-from-scratch/img4.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;300px&quot; width=&quot;300px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This looks pretty cool! Dots and connections between them are what mathematicians call &lt;em&gt;graphs&lt;/em&gt;. The best mathematicians in the world have been studying them, on and off, for about 200 years. This alone should tell you something interesting is happening here – some of the smartest people in the world, the geekiest of the geeks, devote their entire professional lives to tinkering with and studying these (seemingly) simple little things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back to our imaginations, though. Notice how there are some places in the graph where you if you start at a certain dot and try to get to another dot, there’s no connection? This seems bad!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../images/graphs-from-scratch/img4.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;300px&quot; width=&quot;300px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something about our rule from earlier, that ‘every dot needs to be connected to at least one other dot’, isn’t quite good enough. What we need to do is say that ‘starting at any dot in the graph, you need to be able to get to every other dot in the graph by going along the connections’. Let’s try and add some connections so that this works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../images/graphs-from-scratch/img5.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;300px&quot; width=&quot;300px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great! We can now pick any two dots in the entire graph, and there’s a way to go between them. Mathematicians call graphs where you can do this &lt;em&gt;connected.&lt;/em&gt; Connected graphs are a nice way to think about interesting shapes. For example, these shapes are all connected graphs!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../images/graphs-from-scratch/img6.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;300px&quot; width=&quot;300px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the above shapes are pretty, let’s look at two fairly basic connected graphs, the square and the pyramid. The square is nice, we can draw it flatly on paper. The pyramid, though, is a bit trickier. We’re forced to be clever when we squish it onto the paper, and because connections cross each other, it loses the structure that makes it look nice in 3D.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../images/graphs-from-scratch/img7.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;300px&quot; width=&quot;300px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’d be nice if there were some way to represent the dots and connections of the pyramid without having to cleverly squish it down to a 2-dimensional drawing. How might we do this? Try giving it some thought. Think about which features of the graph are important – think about if these two graphs are the same:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../images/graphs-from-scratch/img8.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;300px&quot; width=&quot;300px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some meaningful way, they are! In 99.9% of cases, mathematicians consider the above two graphs to be &lt;em&gt;identical&lt;/em&gt;. This is kind of weird though – it means that the only important thing about graphs is the dots and the relationships between them! In a way, then, this graph:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../images/graphs-from-scratch/img9.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;300px&quot; width=&quot;300px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is the same thing as merely &lt;em&gt;saying&lt;/em&gt; that ‘There are 3 dots. Dot 1 and dot 2 are connected, dot 2 and dot 3 are connected, and dot 3 and dot 1 are connected.’ Let’s invent some way of expressing those relationships with less words. If two dots are connected, let’s put them in some parentheses and separate them by a comma, like this: &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;(dot_{1},dot_{2})&lt;/script&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can do better. Instead of calling them dot 1 and dot 2, let’s just use their numbers, like this: &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;(1,2)&lt;/script&gt;. The order of the numbers doesn’t matter though, so we could flip-flop any of them inside of their parentheses if we wanted to. In a way, these numbers and parentheses really &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; the dots and edges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now, if we want to talk about a bunch of the dots and edges, we just list a bunch of those numbers and parentheses, like this: &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;(1,2), (2,3), (3,1)&lt;/script&gt;. It looks weird to not enclose those pairs of parentheses and numbers with something though, and it would be confusing to just use more parentheses, so let’s use curly braces, like this: &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;\{(1,2), (2,3), (3,1)\}&lt;/script&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mathematicians have fancy names for all of the ideas that we just came up with, but fancy names make it hard to focus on the part of math that matters, so I’m not mentioning them here. If you want to read more, check out this footnote.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s go back to that pyramid from earlier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../images/graphs-from-scratch/img12.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;300px&quot; width=&quot;300px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To accomplish our goal of representing the dots and connections of the pyramid without having to cleverly squish the 3-dimensional shape down to 2, all we have to do is label the dots and then translate their relationships into numbers and parentheses. Easy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../images/graphs-from-scratch/img10.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;300px&quot; width=&quot;300px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After translation, the pyramid is actually just this list of pairs of numbers in parentheses: &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;\{(1,2),(2,3),(3,1),(1,4),(2,4),(3,4)\}&lt;/script&gt;. There’s a lot of repeated stuff in that list of parentheses and numbers though, so maybe there’s a better way to keep track of all the information. Let’s try doing that with a square of numbers, where if there’s a connection between dot a and dot b, we put a &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;1&lt;/script&gt; in the &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;a&lt;/script&gt;th column and &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;b&lt;/script&gt;th row of the square. That’s a lot to think about at once, so let’s go one pair of numbers in the list at a time!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have 4 dots, so we need 4 columns and 4 rows in our square of numbers. Because of this, notice how we’ll always end up using &lt;em&gt;squares&lt;/em&gt; instead of ugly rectangles:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;% &lt;![CDATA[
\begin{bmatrix}0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix} %]]&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you graduated high school, you’ve probably noticed that this is just a matrix. Matrices are, as it turns out, useful ways of encoding information about graphs. Unfortunately, the word ‘matrix’ is burned into most peoples’ minds as quasi-traumatic, and matrices are fundamentally just squares and rectangles of numbers, so I’ll keep calling them that. Now, the first pair is &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;(1,2)&lt;/script&gt;, so let’s put a &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;1&lt;/script&gt; in the spot at the 1st column and 2nd row:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;% &lt;![CDATA[
\begin{bmatrix}0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix} %]]&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the order of the numbers in the pair doesn’t matter, so we also have to remember the pair &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;(2,1)&lt;/script&gt; and then put a &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;1&lt;/script&gt; in the spot at the 2nd column and 1st row:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;% &lt;![CDATA[
\begin{bmatrix}0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix} %]]&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice how there’s a symmetry to the square? Because order doesn’t matter for the numbers in the pair, whichever pair you choose will always have a &lt;em&gt;twin&lt;/em&gt; pair where the numbers are flipped. In our number-square, the twins show up on the opposite side of the diagonal that runs from the top left to the bottom right!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s do one more example of putting a pair and its twin into the square. The next pair in the original list is &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;(2,3)&lt;/script&gt;, and its twin is &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;(3,2)&lt;/script&gt;, so we put &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;1&lt;/script&gt;s into the spot at the 2nd column and 3rd row, and also into the spot at the 3rd column and 2nd row:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;% &lt;![CDATA[
\begin{bmatrix}0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix} %]]&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll fill out the rest for you:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;% &lt;![CDATA[
\begin{bmatrix}0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\ 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\ 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\ 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix} %]]&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Woah! I hope you think this is cool! This beautiful looking square of numbers just popped out of nowhere! Let’s think about it though – why would we have a square where everything is filled in except the diagonal? I encourage you to stop and try to reason through it. If you’re not feeling up to it though, that’s cool too – just look below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../images/graphs-from-scratch/img10.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;300px&quot; width=&quot;300px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, the spaces in the main diagonal represent connections between a dot and itself, but we don’t have any of those in the pyramid. The math-y word for ‘a connection between a dot and itself’ is a &lt;em&gt;loop.&lt;/em&gt; Loops look like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../images/graphs-from-scratch/img11.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;300px&quot; width=&quot;300px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if a graph has no loops, then its corresponding square of numbers will have 0s in the main diagonal. But what about all the 1s? Why is &lt;em&gt;every other possible spot&lt;/em&gt; in the graph’s number-square filled with a 1? Well, it’s because &lt;em&gt;every dot in the graph is connected directly to every other dot.&lt;/em&gt; Look at the pyramid again, and think about this for a second:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../images/graphs-from-scratch/img10.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;300px&quot; width=&quot;300px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whichever dot I pick in the pyramid, I can get to any other dot by only going across one connection! Mathematicians usually call this kind of graph &lt;em&gt;dense.&lt;/em&gt; We just figured out something really interesting – if we take a random, perhaps extremely complicated graph, and go through this simple operation of translating it into pairs of numbers and then a square of numbers, we can &lt;em&gt;instantly&lt;/em&gt; see whether or not it’s dense. All we have to do is check if there are any zeroes that &lt;em&gt;aren’t&lt;/em&gt; on the diagonal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We started with nothing but our intuition and pictures, then made up a language for thinking about those pictures, then made up another language to think about our first language, and out popped a beautiful relationship! We can now translate &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; graph into a number-square, and it magically becomes incredibly easy to know whether or not that graph is dense. We took a normally very complicated, difficult-to-test property, and made it easy enough for a pre-schooler to check.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This&lt;/em&gt; is what math is. Math is the act of starting somewhere interesting and just messing around, playing, until cool things start popping out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s enthralling, it’s visceral, and it’s extremely fun. Reasoning from scratch is one of the purest joys that our world has to offer, and I hope you see at least some of the beauty and appeal of doing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m deeply sorry if it wasn’t shown to you any earlier in your life, but now is your opportunity to go out and explore!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As some fun follow-up questions to get you started, can you think about what a dense graph would look like with 5 dots instead of 4? What about 6, 7, or 10,000 dots? Can you write down what the number-squares would look like for those graphs, even without knowing what the graphs look like themselves?&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Putting two numbers inside of parentheses is called a &lt;em&gt;pair.&lt;/em&gt; When it doesn’t matter in which order we put the numbers inside of the parentheses, it’s called an &lt;em&gt;unordered pair,&lt;/em&gt; and we’d write that for whatever dots you want, call them dot a and dot b, we have that &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;(a,b)=(b,a)&lt;/script&gt;. When it does matter in which order we put the numbers, it’s called an &lt;em&gt;ordered pair,&lt;/em&gt; and we’d write that &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;(a,b) \ne (b,a)&lt;/script&gt;. If the order of the dots in the parentheses doesn’t matter for the entire graph, we call the graph &lt;em&gt;undirected.&lt;/em&gt; If the order of the dots does matter, we call the graph &lt;em&gt;directed.&lt;/em&gt; The connections between dots in directed graphs are usually drawn with arrows instead of lines, because you can think of there being a correct way of going from one dot to another. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>Literature as evidence</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;There is a long history of social-scientists using literature as foundational evidence for their ideas and theories. If you want proof of such a claim, go take a look at the now archaic &lt;em&gt;Totem and Taboo&lt;/em&gt; or even the OG &lt;em&gt;Communist Manifesto&lt;/em&gt;. For a more modern version, just crack open &lt;em&gt;Things Hidden since the Foundation of the World&lt;/em&gt;. You’ll be inundated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first, this seems laughable. Literature? As scientific evidence? Aren’t most great works of literature &lt;em&gt;fictional?&lt;/em&gt; How can something fictional possibly be used rigorously?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alas, it cannot! Obviously, one should not use fictional literature as &lt;em&gt;rigorous, scientific&lt;/em&gt; evidence in the sense of ‘providing explicit information about an event or occurrence.’ If I claim that Alice killed Bob (the poor bastard), and then justify my claim by citing a classic Dostoevsky novel where Alice kills Bob (in this hypothetical world, such a novel exists), you’d rightly inform me of my idiocy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As scholars of the humanities and social sciences love to point out, rigorous science isn’t everything. Speaking from experience, this is a hard pill to swallow. Despite the fact that extracting precise scientific value from literature is nearly impossible, literature does have an interesting characteristic that allows for the embedding and subsequent extraction of useful information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The characteristic of which I speak stems from the fact that literature is a subset of books, and books are &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindy_effect&quot;&gt;Lindy&lt;/a&gt;. This means that any literature in the zeitgeist of the current day has survived the cumulative literary scrutiny of all human beings who lived between the publishing of such literature and now. This is an extremely difficult thing to do, which is why we see such a tiny number of pieces of older literature that have maintained their high graces in the cultural tastes of every era since they were published.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s also a useful trait! We can (roughly) deduce that old literature which has been in the zeitgeist for a long time encodes something deep about the preferences of human beings. I suspect this is the utility that people like Freud, Marx, and Girard saw in it. Analyzing literature is then akin to analyzing a highly-agreed-upon version of human values and preferences, something which is extremely valuable if you’re studying human values and preferences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next time that you encounter a claim that makes use of literature for evidence, do your best to evaluate it while keeping the above characteristic in mind. Social science often seems like useless and obscurantist gobbledegook, but some of the people that operate in this space know what they’re doing, and their ideas are good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sláinte!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Base pleasure</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Where do the most visceral, intense pleasures in life come from? I’d say eating, procreating, and positive socializing. What about the most visceral, intense pains? I’d say bodily harm and negative socializing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to these &lt;em&gt;visceral&lt;/em&gt; pleasures and pains, humans experience a variety of other pleasures and pains that are more intellectual in nature – things like the contentment from solving an interesting problem, the altruistic buzz from helping another person that you don’t know, or the sadness from reflecting on an exam gone poorly. These sorts of pleasures and pains seem toned way down in subjective magnitude compared to the more visceral types.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the visceral pleasures and pains I listed aren’t unique to humans. They arise for most forms of life on Earth! There’s a huge class of organisms that experience eating, procreating, positive socializing, bodily harm, and negative socializing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We consider it a pretty standard, well-accepted view that such a class of organisms is capable of experiencing &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; amount of morally significant pleasure and pain. What seems more far-fetched is that that such a class of organisms is capable of experiencing morally significant pleasure and pain of &lt;em&gt;the same degree as humans.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second claim seems more far-fetched because of a moral intuition most humans have. That moral intuition says ‘something like the number of neurons a given organism has plays an important role in the moral relevancy of its pleasure and pain’. Barring this moral intuition, we have no reason to believe that non-human organisms can’t experience morally significant pleasure and pain of the same degree as humans! A priori, why should we believe that rabbits aren’t capable of experiencing visceral pleasures and pains that are identically morally relevant to humans? What about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQBOidTHwgQ&quot;&gt;lady bugs&lt;/a&gt;? Rabbits, humans, and lady bugs all experience eating, procreating, positive socializing, bodily harm, and negative socializing!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The point of this reflection is to demonstrate that despite millennia of research and thought about the questions of meta-ethics and philosophy of mind, we’re still absolutely sure of almost nothing. Nearly all of our philosophizing about the universe is built up by using our moral intuitions, which we have no reason to believe reflect any sort of universal values! If an alien showed up tomorrow from a galaxy far, far away, it would probably hold moral intuitions completely different than nearly every single one of our ours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our entire system of ethics could well be false to &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; other forms of intelligent life in the universe – this would make for extremely difficult interspecies negotiation if aliens were to come to Earth, or even if we were to create sentient AI here &lt;em&gt;on&lt;/em&gt; Earth.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The illusory stupidity of politicians</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;American media has a long history of portraying politicians, and people of power more generally, as stupid and naive. Saturday Night Live’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JUWSLlz0Fdo&amp;amp;list=PLIMQGnRxY3JH4jtVG5zjmW0Eqqt_jzWSF&quot;&gt;political skits&lt;/a&gt; are wonderful examples of this. SNL has a distinctly liberal lean, and so tends to focus on GOP figures, but there are many examples of analogous media portrayals from the conservative side of the Overton window, too. Articles and TV segments abound from all across the political spectrum that propound the blatant idiocy and plebeian nature of the other side’s figureheads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the media portrayals, are politicians actually stupid and naive? I think the answer is a resounding &lt;em&gt;hell no&lt;/em&gt;. Take someone like Steve Bannon, who has been pilloried by the media (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/01/04/steve-bannon-michael-wolff-book-donald-trump-216243&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.themarysue.com/steve-bannon-stupid-trump-documentary/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and recently &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thedailybeast.com/steve-bannon-has-become-the-one-thing-we-never-thought-hed-be-boring&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). It seems to me that the general characterization of Steve Bannon is as a naive, corrupt, sometimes idiotic, and boring guy. If you’re politically liberal and reading this, I’d guess that you agree (if you don’t, send me an email or a DM!). Now, try to gently put that conception aside for a moment and watch &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH5QzuzD01A&quot;&gt;this video&lt;/a&gt; of him discussing China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I first saw it, I was blown away at how articulate he was and how parsimonious some of his explanations were. Surely there was a mistake. This was &lt;em&gt;Steve Bannon&lt;/em&gt;, a known dumbass, a ‘lying, fascist prick’! That fool couldn’t possibly be referencing 老百姓 and Chinese political philosophy! He just, you know, spends all day reading the shit that Breitbart writers spew… he, he…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I implore you to try this exercise with any politician you think is stupid and/or naive (with the exception of Trump – Trump seems to either be (1) a counterexample to this pattern, or (2) very secretly intelligent). Try and find a longer interview or piece of writing from the politician that was created during a period when they weren’t in the heyday of their political career. I suspect that you’ll be surprised by their cogency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question then becomes &lt;em&gt;why?&lt;/em&gt; Why are we deluded by the media about the intelligence and ability of our politicians?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One explanation is that it’s just another example of partisan conflict. The powers that be on either side of the political spectrum want their political opposition to seem stupid, naive, weak, etc. so that voters are less inclined to vote for said opposition. While perhaps correct, this is uninteresting. It’s the same story we’ve heard for years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A more interesting question to ask is not just ‘why are we deluded by the media’, but rather &lt;em&gt;why do people eat it up?&lt;/em&gt; The media can propagate whatever messaging it wants, but at some fundamental level, the populace has to swallow what it’s being fed. Various psychological tricks are routinely used to make the act of swallowing easier on us poor bastards, but there must be some degree of deep acceptance of the information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the case of the illusory stupidity of politicians, I’d chalk it up to an innate desire to feel as though one is smarter than one actually is. It’s tempting to believe that you could be doing what the politicians are doing. It’s tempting to tell yourself that if circumstances had been a bit different, if you had really given it a good college try, you could &lt;em&gt;totally&lt;/em&gt; have gotten elected. In the safety of your own head, it’s all too easy to ‘know’ that you’re an expert on the issues that face the nation and the difficulties of becoming an elected official.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Dunning-Kruger effect rears its ugly head here – most Americans simply aren’t conscientious enough to realize that the world of foreign affairs and public policy is extremely difficult to think about and act competently inside of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps most things are like this! &lt;em&gt;Perhaps the world is a bit more complex than how the media portrays it!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A new era of more right</title>
        <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;an-explanation&quot;&gt;an explanation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today is the day that I begin surfacing words from my personal reflection-journal/digital-thought-notebook thing. I have a (sort of) daily cadence of writing in it, because doing so helps me keep my head on straight. If I don’t work through the ambient thoughts in my brain in a systematic way like this, the thoughts either implode into nothingness or explode into existential and epistemic anxiety. Both of those outcomes are bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plus, I tweeted &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/keegan_mcnamara/status/1188337574299013120&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; the other day, so I figured that instead of perpetuating the problems I pointed out, I’d start trying to solve them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A large part of me hates disturbing the former serenity and distilled nature of this website with something as filthy and unkempt as mere &lt;em&gt;thoughts&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;reflections&lt;/em&gt; (the bile bubbles to the back of my throat as I type), but I’ve decided that if there’s any net positive effect on humanity as a result of my making such things public, then I ought to do it. As anyone who has taken an Analysis course knows, net positivity is not difficult to do ( &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;\forall \epsilon &gt; 0,\exists...&lt;/script&gt;), so I think I indeed ought to start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;some-changes&quot;&gt;some changes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d still like there to be features that allow for some semblance of filterability on my writings, so I’ve added a &lt;a href=&quot;https://keeganm.org/categories&quot;&gt;categories&lt;/a&gt; page and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://keeganm.org/tags&quot;&gt;tags&lt;/a&gt; page. Implementing categories and tags from scratch in Jekyll was a bit of a pain in the ass, but I think it’ll be worth it in the longer term. I also have a fair number of thoughts about math and physics-related things, so I added MathJax support (do you even &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;\LaTeX&lt;/script&gt;, bro?) for when I desperately need to reminisce on the days I spent breathing in toxic amounts of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhNUjg9X4g8&quot;&gt;Hagoromo&lt;/a&gt; dust. Again, Jekyll is kind of a pain in the ass to do stuff like this with, but as my good friend Brennie would say, the ‘worth is high’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll be categorizing these more spontaneous thoughts and writings as ‘posts’, as opposed to the far more time-consuming to produce ‘essays’ and ‘videos’. Perhaps someday I’ll gather the courage to put my poetry and prose on here. We’ll see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve also changed the look and feel of the site. More specifically…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I changed the paragraph font to what I consider the most beautiful of all serifs, Libre Baskerville. I previously used Helvetica, which is nice for headings, but miserable to read for long periods of time. Such is the life of a sans.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I removed all of the colors from the site, with the notable exception of salmon (&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff5858;&quot;&gt;#ff5858&lt;/span&gt;). I use the same salmon color on my &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/keegan_mcnamara&quot;&gt;twitter profile&lt;/a&gt;, and I enjoy having a cohesive brand identity in this one, very limited way. I’m also a proponent of design minimalism, which leads me to…&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I thinned out all of the lines used for bounding boxes. This allows the elements on the screen to breathe, and it also focuses attention on the ones that matter. The bounding boxes themselves are actually totally unnecessary, but I like how they demarcate territory and group related elements together. They’re also somewhat of an homage to Engelbart and Kay’s invention of the notion of ‘windows’ for computer graphical user interfaces (read more &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_graphical_user_interface&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). Rectangles are cool.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s everything pertinent that I can think of for the moment. Sláinte!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>My Essay in Palladium Magazine</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I wrote a piece for Palladium about the video game industry, the increasingly exploitative tools it uses to gain/retain users, and why we need change. Read it &lt;a href=&quot;https://palladiummag.com/2019/09/12/the-siren-call-of-video-games-amid-decaying-social-fabric/&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Sport and Invisible Propaganda</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;You know the feeling. You’re at the stadium, the anthem is being sung while a wounded veteran is paraded around next to the professional players. Tears well in your eyes, and it’s as though a balloon filled with liquid pride is gradually expanding in your upper abdomen. It’s incredibly unique – I, frankly, can’t think of more than a handful of instances wherein such a deep appreciation and sense of pride can be brought about in myself as if due to the flip of a switch. But why? Why does every American who’s ever seen a professional sports event know this feeling so vividly and experience it so intensely?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Noam Chomsky would probably turn to his propaganda model of media for an explanation. In its essence, Chomsky would say, the media’s primary purpose is as a tool to indoctrinate and suppress the masses. Prima facie, perhaps that claim sounds like just another academic spewing some “goddamned anti-American garbage.” But consider for a moment the perspective of a Martian peering down on America from outer space. This Martian would see a truly remarkable concentration of power and wealth within the government and the largest corporations. It seems to follow immediately that because humans are greedy creatures, those entities that control the vast majority of power and wealth in the US would want to continue to control that power and wealth. So then, as the astute Martian would point out, it makes perfect sense that those institutions would utilize a significant amount of the vast resources at their disposal to maintain their respective stakes. Well, as it were, some of the largest companies in the US are media companies. In addition to huge sums of capital, they control massive information distribution networks (e.g. TV, radio, social media, etc…), and the Martian would see that those networks and that capital were being appropriated to mold the public’s conception of the world away from the reality of corporate and governmental fascism and instead inculcate them with docility in order to maintain the status quo of power and wealth. What’s frightening about Chomsky’s model is that it’s coldly rational, unbiased politically, and posits that the existence of the propagandistic media is merely an emergent property of the concentrations of wealth that arise in capitalistic societies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through this lens, let’s take a deeper look at the culture of sports in modern society. Consider a relatively simple question that actually cuts quite deeply into the issue – why are athletes in the NFL paid so much money? Well, perhaps the prima facie answer is that they’re just extremely well qualified on a physical basis, and therefore deserving of special pay. Consider though that professional marathon runners, who are extremely well qualified on a physical basis (perhaps even moreso than NFL players), make vastly less money than NFL players. For example, Tamirat Tola, a 2016 Olympic Bronze medalist from Ethiopia, made a paltry $93,750 in 2018, while Jimmy Garropolo, the QB for the San Francisco 49ers, made $43,100,000. Physical qualification can’t be the answer. However, things become clear when you look at how much sponsorship money is being spent on each sport, and from who that money is coming. The NFL’s sponsorship revenue totaled $1.32 Billion in the 2017-2018 season, while the Professional Road Running Organization’s (PRRO) total prize money available for the 2018 season was a mere $330,000. The NFL’s sponsors are companies like Anheuser-Busch, Castrol, PepsiCo, and Frito-Lay, whereas the PRRO’s sponsors are companies like Publix (a grocery-store chain) and a small credit union in Washington DC. The NFL players are making more money because there’s a helluva lot more institutional money being poured into their market. The natural question to ask then is this: why aren’t companies like Anheuser-Busch and PepsiCo sponsoring the PRRO circuit? Well, it’s because the American public isn’t watching televised marathons – they’re watching their favorite NFL, MLB, NHL, and NBA teams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People put a pretty astonishingly large amount of time and mental resources into sports. If you ask your next-door neighbor how your local NFL team is doing, you’re likely to get an extremely articulate and complex response that takes into account the abilities of individual players, the coaching staff’s play calling decisions, the player trading market, etc… They’re probably going to cite specific statistics and be able to discuss intricacies that required hours of observation, research, and thought. And it makes sense – in our society, there are things that people can use their intelligence on, take politics for example, but most can’t really get involved in those things in any meaningful way. So instead, they spend their intelligence on other things that are cognitively intensive, yet also accessible – things like spectator sports. Sports intensely occupy the minds of a vast majority of the population and diffuse a huge amount of latent time and intellectual capacity, which is precisely what the corporate and governmental entities that control the majority of power and wealth would want. So it’s quite natural that companies like Anheuser-Busch and PepsiCo are sponsoring the big spectator sports associations – those associations are doing a wonderful thing in the eyes of such companies. They’re efficiently squandering the time and cognitive effort of the broader populace that could otherwise be used to gain a deeper understanding of reality and potentially organize to bring about change in the upper echelons of power. Furthermore, it makes total sense that the armed forces show up, parade around veterans, and hold subtly nationalist ceremonies – they’re the grandaddy of the entities that have a vested interest in supporting such a quiescence of the broader populace. In an attempt to not inflame passions, I’ll leave that discussion to Chomsky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let’s return to our initial situation. You’re watching your favorite team play, and you rise for the national anthem. Your heart swells with pride as the talented singer belts the anthem alongside a wounded veteran. With our newfound understanding, though, the sentiment of that situation changes. Spectator sports enforce jingoism, promote consumerism, and indoctrinate an impressionable society to maintain the status quo of power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think before you buy that ticket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peace.&lt;/p&gt;
