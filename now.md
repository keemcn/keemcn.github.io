_(This is [a now page](https://nownownow.com/about), and if you have your own site, you should make one, too.)_

I haven't been writing as much recently – I've been trying to work hard and focus. The big things in my life are currently:
- building something of value
- building personal infrastructure

I'll elaborate.

## building something of value
To recapitulate what I had written here a few months ago, I've come to the conclusion that I don't want to hop onto the hedonic treadmill of working for 'the man'. I don't want a mere _job_. I want a *career*. I want to use my abilities in interesting ways. I want to either start something of my own or join something very early that one of my extremely talented friends have started. I'm vehemently opposed to wasting away my life at an Amazon equivalent bigco – I'd rather work my ass off to make something of value to the world, then use the generated capital to do something even more valuable, and so on, ad infinitum. This is the founder mindset as I see it, and it has infected my mind.

In that spirit, I've joined a well-funded stealth startup that was created by a few extremely talented friends of mine. My formal title is 'Technical Product Manager', which for now means that I'm helping craft the product and writing a ton of code. The process of creation has been immensely satisfying thus far, and I'm excited to see just how far me and my fellow team members can take a vision and how well we can craft a future out of it.

## building personal infrastructure
Over the course of the past few months that I spent trying to find interesting things to work on, actually finding those things, and then beginning the work, I've come to realize the importance of having extremely strong personal infrastructure.

Personal infrastructure, as I see it, is consciously acknowledging the existence of a set of tools that you consistently use in your life, and also embarking upon the endeavor of actively filling out that set. The tools that you use in your life can be composed of software, hardware, emotions, behaviors, habits, mental models, or really anything that you think fits the bill. Actively searching for and acknowledging that something you use consistently is a tool of this form is both extremely difficult and extremely rewarding. It's difficult in the sense that a lot of these 'tools' are embedded invisibly into your daily life, and it's rewarding in the sense that once acknowledged, you can actively begin to shape the tools and their usages to better attain what you want in life.

To give a more concrete example of what this process looks like for me, I realized that I go for walks in nature on a fairly consistent basis, and that the habit is triggered by specific events or conditions in my life. If I'm stressed or feeling extremely cooped up, I just go out and do it without really thinking about the process of doing it. Very low meta-awareness. At some point, it occurred to me that this was a tool of mine, and I've now learned how to implement it more effectively and use it pre-emptively to prevent those feelings of stress and being overly cooped up.

Another concrete example of a tool I've adopted that has seriously changed how my mind works is a piece of software called [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/). Its ability to be programmed to my desire has allowed me to interact with my computer in a completely new way, and has opened up new pathways of thinking and working that I wouldn't really have dreamed existed prior.

This process and framing of building personal infrastructure has been a huge update for me, and it's something that I don't really foresee myself stopping for the rest of my life.

I haven't been writing as much recently – I've been trying to work hard and focus. The big things in my life are currently
- figuring out a career
- figuring out a life

I'll elaborate.
## figuring out a career
I've come to the conclusion that I don't want to hop onto the hedonic treadmill of working for 'the man'. I don't want a mere _job_. I want a *career*. I want to use my abilities in interesting ways. I want to either start something of my own or join something very early that one of my extremely talented friends have started. I'm vehemently opposed to wasting away my life at an Amazon equivalent bigco – I'd rather work my ass off to make something of value to the world, then use the generated capital to do something even more valuable, and so on, ad infinitum. This is the founder mindset as I see it, and it has infected my mind.

## figuring out a life
First, for this section, a blurb from my last update: "If I were to graph self-perceived autonomy over the course of my life, I think that there's a big peak right after graduating from college. I can choose to move my life anywhere in the entire world! I can choose which people to keep in my life and which to let go! Most of my structure and obligations disappear! I can completely renovate my moral foundation!"

I graduated in December with a BA in mathematics and minor in astronomy from CU Boulder, and I moved to Berkeley, CA shortly thereafter! As I outlined above, I've settled on cultivating the founder mindset. I've settled on optimizing my location for (1) the accessibility of natural beauty/recreation and (2) the accessibility of networks of brilliant people.

Boulder is very good for my criteria, but Berkeley is better. In my estimation, the density of brilliance in the Bay Area is higher than any other large metropolitan area in the world. It is simply _the_ place to be for any activities that require brilliance – things like starting companies, producing art, and writing good blog posts. I'm excited to be here, and I've been loving it so far :)

Hopefully I can do justice to myself by writing out a bit more of what goes through my head on here. We'll see what happens in the next few months! -->

<!--- OCTOBER 2019
The big things in my life are currently
- figuring out a job
- figuring out a life
- reading and thinking (more than usual)
- working on [Aloud](https://aloud.fyi)

I'll elaborate.
## figuring out a job
I'm currently doing an exchange semester at the National University of Singapore, and I graduate from school this December of 2019 (woohoo for finishing a semester early and giving myself crippling existential angst!). I've arrived at the conclusion that I need to figure out a place to work at for a while afterwards.

I've been applying to APM programs because I think that I fit the job descriptions well, and I find true enjoyment in tying together my skills to create cool stuff.

I'm also interested in research roles, particularly at companies like DeepMind and OpenAI (I have high conviction that the intelligence field is one of the most important that I'll have the opportunity to work on in my lifetime).

## figuring out a life
If I were to graph self-perceived autonomy over the course of my life, I think that there's a big peak right after graduating from college. I can choose to move my life anywhere in the entire world! I can choose which people to keep in my life and which to let go! Most of my structure and obligations disappear! I can completely renovate my moral foundation!

The combinatorial explosion of possibilities gives me analysis paralysis, but I'm trying my best to figure out who I am and what I want.

## reading and thinking (more than usual)
In that pursuit, I'm spending **a lot** of time reading and thinking. I squeezed all of my classes into Thursday and Friday, so I have five days every week to do whatever I want. I've thus far elected to ingest a slew of information and ideas (books, blogs, poems, podcasts, movies, etc ...) and systematically think about them to help me understand myself and my desires better.

## working on [Aloud](https://aloud.fyi)
I can't help myself from doing something entrepreneurial with all this free time, so me and a friend have been working on a project called [Aloud](https://aloud.fyi). Aloud is a product I've wanted to exist for a very long time, and I'm happy that I can now deliver it to others.

We've raised a little bit of money from 1517 fund and CU Boulder to help get things started, and we're very excited about launching and growing.  -->
