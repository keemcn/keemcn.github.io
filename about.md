I'm currently a Technical Product Manager at a seed-stage stealth startup, and I graduated from [CU Boulder](https://www.colorado.edu/) in 2019 with a BA in mathematics. In college, I was a **Research Scientist Intern** at [Amazon](https://aws.amazon.com/), where in the summer of ‘18 I worked on the Data Center Systems team and analyzed the power draw of different components inside of Amazon’s global network of Data Centers. I interned there in the summer of ‘17, too, where I did a large-scale analysis of hard drive failures.

In college I was also a **Venture Partner** for [Contrary Capital](https://contrarycap.com/), a student-led VC fund where I sourced deals and found the best startups at my alma mater.

I also interned in a variety of roles at some great startups when I was in high school. These include **Graphic Design** @ [Human Design](https://humandesign.com/) and **QA Engineering** and **Front-end Development** @ [Wayin](https://www.wayin.com/) (acq. Cheetah Digital).
